These files were generated by logging the converted .bmp file as `Array.from(image.data)` when loaded in luna paint.

Since 16-bit depth files aren't supported by Luna Paint, these value were output directly using this decoder after the loaded image (converted to 8 bit) was verified as looking correct via a simple visual check. This isn't ideal as it's testing the output of the program, but combined with testing the 8 bit converted images it's likely correct and helps improve test coverage and detect regressions.
